## Mistakes I made ‚ùå

- **Not using sets for optimal solution:** Seaching trough sets take way less time than searching them linearly.
- **Taking break everyday to relax mind:** It was reqired I suppose (Maybe not a mistake)

- Many of the silly mistakes have been eliinated till now

*"I surely made it so far with consistency. I realised my efficiency is too low! Gotta work on that"*
