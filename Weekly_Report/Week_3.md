## Best page of the week 📜

![diagram](pics/week3.jpg)

This small diagram effectively explains the logic for the problem **Next permutation**.

---

## Mistakes I made ❌

- **Not using sets for optimal solution:** Seaching trough sets take way less time than searching them linearly.
- **Taking break everyday to relax mind:** It was reqired I suppose (Maybe not a mistake)

- Many of the silly mistakes have been eliinated till now
