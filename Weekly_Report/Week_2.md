## ❌ Mistakes I made (and fixes)

- **Confusing ordered vs unordered maps:** This made space/time reasoning messy.  
  - *Fix:* Re-read hash-map vs ordered-map behavior and practice a few examples to internalize differences.

- **Avoided built-ins (max/min) and overcomplicated solutions:** I used long if-else instead of simple built-ins.  
  - *Fix:* Practice idiomatic solutions and keep a cheatsheet of commonly used language built-ins.

- **Wrong study approach — binge-watching lectures then rewatching:** Rewatching multiple times after every failed attempt wasted time.  
  - *Fix:* Follow a structured plan. Watch a short concept video, attempt the problem, then read editorial only after a focused struggle.

- **Attempting problems after watching lectures:** I lost the valuable learning gained from first-principles struggle.  
  - *Fix:* Code first. If stuck for 30–45 mins, then watch the lecture or editorial, and re-implement from memory.
