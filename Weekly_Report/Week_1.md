## ❌ Mistakes I made

- **Making mistakes in loop:** After completing dozens of problems on patterns, I was still not clear. The numbers were going out of bounds or few indexes were not even getting included until I realsised  

<br>

- **Was declaring the array wrong:** I created a new array instead of making changes in the same array. That increased space complexity significantly.
<br>

 ``` vector<int> &arr ``` -> changes occur in same array  
 
 ``` vector<int> arr ``` -> New array is created to make changes
 
<br>


- **Confused the parameters in array declaration and initialisation:** Both of them have different way of passing parameters. I interchanged both of the until I realised

<br>


- **Tons of mistakes in two pointer approach:** messing both of the variables. I'm still not perfect in this :(
  
<br>


- Minor mistakes in almost all of the problems, corrected them

<br>


- Sometimes getting better solution before brute, and then ponder for what brute solution could be...(If it counts as a mistake)

<br>

## 🎓 Key Learnings

**🧠 Algorithmic Insights:**
- Recursion can replace loops in many scenarios
- Pattern recognition accelerates problem-solving speed  

**📝 Documentation Discovery:**
- Writing detailed explanations solidifies understanding
- Multiple approaches help see different perspectives
- Good comments make revisiting problems effortless
- You think you understand, until you try to write it down

**⚡ Performance Realizations:**
- Sometimes optimisation is just Trade-offs between time and space
- Time complexity matters more as input size grows
- Space optimization often requires algorithmic creativity
